# Tweeter Project

Tweeter is a simple, single-page Twitter clone.

This project showcases a Twitter-like application with a range of features. Users can create tweets, post them, and view existing tweets in reverse-chronological order. A character counter ensures that tweets stay within the allowed limit, and error messages promptly inform users if their tweet does not meet the expected standards.

The application also demonstrates proficiency in various front-end technologies, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, and AJAX, providing a seamless user experience from smartphones to large displays. Additionally, the back-end skills are demonstrated using Node.js and Express, enabling smooth handling of server-side operations.
